**Description**

MiniCoreNet — Bring your network with you.
Anywhere. Anytime. No strings attached.

MiniCoreNet is a portable, plug-and-play micro-network designed to give technicians, developers, cybersecurity professionals, and remote teams a secure, offline-capable environment for file sharing, communication, and collaboration—without needing centralized infrastructure. Run it from a USB stick, external drive, or local folder—MiniCoreNet transforms any machine into part of a secure, peer-capable communications network. It’s the ultimate fallback system for resilient operations, private collaboration, and digital independence.

**Key Features**

**Portable and OS-independent**

No installation needed. Can run from any drive on any system with Bash and basic utilities.

**Secure file sharing**

Share files across connected nodes using encrypted methods. No cloud, no exposure.

**Peer-to-peer communication**

Send and receive secure messages over LAN, VPN, or offline environments.

**Autonomous node design**

Every instance of MiniCoreNet is a functional micro-node—no servers, no sign-ins.

**Modular utility scripts**

Built-in tools for verification, encryption, diagnostics, and routing.

**Ideal for:**

• Freelance IT Technicians.

• Freelance Developers.

• Freelance Cybersecurity Specialists.

• Digital nomads.

• Disaster recovery teams.

• Airgapped environments.

• Ethical Hackers

• Cybersecurity Enthusiasts

**Installation**

MiniCoreNet is designed to be fully portable and requires no traditional installation. It can be cloned, copied, or downloaded onto any directory, external drive, or USB stick. To begin, simply clone the repository or download the ZIP file:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minicorenet.git Or download the ZIP: Download ZIP

2. Once extracted, navigate into the project directory. A one-time dependency setup script is provided to ensure all required tools are installed. These include essential utilities such as rsync, gpg, ncat, and other commonly available Linux packages. To install dependencies:

3. Make the script executable: chmod +x install-deps.sh

4. Run the script with root privileges: sudo ./install-deps.sh

5. After this initial step, MiniCoreNet is fully functional. You can now run it from any Linux system without needing to repeat the installation process.

**Usage**

Using MiniCoreNet is simple. Once inside the main directory, launch the primary script to begin using the toolset. The system provides access to secure file sharing, node-to-node messaging, encrypted communication, and status broadcasting. All operations are CLI-based and modular.

1. To start, run: ./minicorenet.sh
   
2. From here, users can:

• Securely share files with connected peers using encrypted transfers.

• Send encrypted messages over LAN or VPN without relying on third-party servers.

• Connect to another MiniCoreNet node by specifying their IP or hostname.

• Broadcast local system status to notify peers of availability or alerts.

• Wipe logs and temporary data to maintain operational privacy (optional).

Each function is modular, meaning users can customize, replace, or expand functionality depending on their workflow or security requirements. MiniCoreNet can run indefinitely as a background service or be used on demand for quick tasks. It works in remote offices, labs, secure environments, or any situation where centralized infrastructure is unavailable or undesirable.

**Philosophy**

MiniCoreNet isn’t just a project. It’s a mindset:

• Private, resilient, and sovereign-by-design.

• Built to outlast outages, outmaneuver censorship, and outclass bloated cloud platforms, MiniCoreNet enables professionals to communicate and share data freely without relying on third parties.

• Use it in the office, at home, during travel, or in emergencies. If there’s a computer, you can operate.
