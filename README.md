**Description**

**MiniCoreNet** — Bring your network with you. Anywhere. Anytime. No strings attached.

MiniCoreNet is a portable, plug-and-play micro-network designed to give technicians, developers, cybersecurity professionals, and remote teams a secure, offline-capable environment for file sharing, communication, and collaboration—without needing centralized infrastructure. Run it from a USB stick, external drive, or local folder—MiniCoreNet transforms any machine into part of a secure, peer-capable communications network. It’s the ultimate fallback system for resilient operations, private collaboration, and digital independence.

**Key Features**

**Portable and OS-independent**  
No installation needed. Can run from any drive on any system with Bash and basic utilities.

**Secure file sharing**  
Share files across connected nodes using encrypted methods. No cloud, no exposure.

**Peer-to-peer communication**  
Send and receive secure messages over LAN, VPN, or offline environments.

**Autonomous node design**  
Every instance of MiniCoreNet is a functional micro-node—no servers, no sign-ins.

**Anonymity Stack (NEW)**  
Built-in MAC address randomization, Tor routing, and WireGuard VPN integration. Optionally runs in full stealth mode.

**Modular utility scripts**  
Includes logging, diagnostics, integrity checks, trust provisioning, and more.

**Ideal for:**

• Freelance IT Technicians
• Freelance Developers
• Cybersecurity Specialists
• Digital nomads
• Disaster recovery teams
• Airgapped environments
• Ethical Hackers
• Cybersecurity Enthusiasts

**Installation**

MiniCoreNet is fully portable and requires no traditional installation. It can be cloned, copied, or downloaded onto any directory, external drive, or USB stick.

To begin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gainer552/minicorenet.git
```

Or download the ZIP.

Navigate into the project directory and run the setup script:

```bash
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
```

This installs required tools like `rsync`, `gpg`, `macchanger`, `tor`, and others.

**Usage**

Once inside the main directory, launch the system:

```bash
./start.sh
```

You can:

• Connect to trusted nodes
• Provision authentication
• Share/download files securely
• Run integrity checks
• Enable full anonymity (MAC + IP + Tor/VPN routing)

Each tool is modular and self-contained.

**Philosophy**

MiniCoreNet isn’t just a tool — it’s a mindset:

• Private, resilient, and sovereign-by-design
• Built to outlast outages, outmaneuver censorship, and outclass bloated cloud platforms
• If there’s a computer, you can operate.
